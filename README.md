# Machine Learning: Fundementals and More

This repository aims to serve as a one-stop shop to take a look into a of fundemntal (and sometimes more advanced) machine learning concepts. This is an effort to i) help people be able to re-call a concept they can vaguely within 5 minutes and ii) (perhaps more importantly) to force me to start preparing for ML interviews.
