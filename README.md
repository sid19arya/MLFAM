# Machine Learning: Fundementals and More

This repository aims to serve as a one-stop shop to take a look into a of fundemntal (and sometimes more advanced) machine learning concepts. This is an effort to i) help people be able to re-call a concept they can vaguely within 5 minutes and ii) (perhaps more importantly) to force me to start preparing for ML interviews.


# Structure


There is a enourmous number of concepts that a seasoned ML engineer/research needs to be aware of. We will split these concepts into convenient categories to make this repository more digestible for the reader. The caregories are:

1. Model / Model Architecture
    1. Pretty self-explanatory
    2. Examples: [CNN, RNN, Transformer]
2. Architecture Component
    1. These are key components that either behave uniquely, or have a unique use case. The components are somewhat definative of the architecture, but ofcourse you can mix-and-match these components to make wierd models (I recommedn this for messing around, I DO NOT recommend this for actually achieving a downstream task)
    2. Examples: [Feed Forward Layer, Attention Module, Convolution, Dropout]
3. Underlying concepts:
    1. These are concepts that serve as the heart for what you are doing. Ever present yet rarely visible. These are frequently abstracted away by convenient modules (some of these concepts are purely theoretical too), but itS helpful and pretty cool to know how these work
    2. Examples: [Backpropagation, Autodiff, Feature Representations, Bias Varience Tradeoff]
4. Practical Considerations:
    1. These are meant to create a checklist that any Data Scientist / ML Engineer should be able go through for a model off the dome. These are either concepts that you 1) took care of appropriately, 2) intentially and justifiable did not take care of.
    2. Examples: [Train/Test/Val Split, Hyperperameter Tuning [GridSearch], Evaluation Metric]


There is a dedicated directory for each one of these categories. Within them, each concept is covered in either a markdown file or a jupyter notebook with a code demonstration.

Below are tables for each one of these categories listing all relevant concepts and a direct link to the relevant file covering them.
